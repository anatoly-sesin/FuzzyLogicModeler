Subject area and specific task
Development of a controller controlling a water pump valve in order to save water in a soil irrigation system.
Description of the input data
Soil moisture data
Variable name: ω = "soil moisture"
Term-set of values:
T_1= "saturated"
T_2= "optimal"
T_3= "insufficient" 
Carrier: U=[0..50]
Syntactic rule: soil moisture measured by a tensiometer on a scale from 0 to 50 centimeters.
Semantic rule: defined by membership functions, for the value T_1-μ_1 (U), for T_2-μ_2 (U), for T_3-μ_3 (U) and for T_4-μ_4 (U). Moreover, the first of them corresponds to the fuzzy subset M_1, the second — M_2, the third — M_3, the fourth — M_4.
Relative humidity data
Variable name: ω = "relative humidity"
Term-set of values:
T_1= "low"
T_2= "medium"
T_3= "normal"
T_4= "high"  
Carrier: U=[0%..100%]
Syntactic rule: relative humidity of the air as a percentage.
Semantic rule: defined by membership functions, for the value T_1-μ_1 (U), for T_2-μ_2 (U), for T_3-μ_3 (U) and for T_4-μ_4 (U). Moreover, the first of them corresponds to the fuzzy subset M_1, the second — M_2, the third — M_3, the fourth — M_4.
Air temperature data
Variable name: ω = "air temperature"
Term-set of values:
T_1= "low"
T_2= "medium"
T_3= "normal"
T_4= "high"  
Carrier: U=[0..40]
Syntactic rule: air temperature in degrees Celsius.
Semantic rule: defined by membership functions, for the value T_1-μ_1 (U), for T_2-μ_2 (U), for T_3-μ_3 (U) and for T_4-μ_4 (U). Moreover, the first of them corresponds to the fuzzy subset M_1, the second — M_2, the third — M_3, the fourth — M_4.
Description of the output data
Water pump pressure level data
Variable name: ω = "water pump pressure"
Term-set of values:
T_1= "very weak"
T_2= "weak"
T_3= "medium"
T_4= "high"  
T_5= "maximum"
Carrier: U=[0%..100%]
Syntactic rule: characterizes the pressure of a water pump controlled by changing the valve opening on a percentage relative scale.
Semantic rule: defined by membership functions, for the value T_1-μ_1 (U), for T_2-μ_2 (U), for T_3-μ_3 (U), for T_4-μ_4 (U) and for T_5-μ_5 (U). Moreover, the first of them corresponds to the fuzzy subset M_1, the second — M_2, the third — M_3, the fourth — M_4, the fifth — M_5.
